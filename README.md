In this folder, several go projects will be created, the idea of this projects is to improve as a backend developer with the use of GO.

The idea behind this will to follow up the projects and replicate with the least amount of help from the guides, in each file I will include a readme to explain the purpose of the project from my own perspective, explain the libraries used there and emphasis important aspects of the golang language in each project.

The projects included will be:
-Web server
-CRUD API
-MYSQL book management system
-Slackbot for age calculation
-Slackbot for file uploading
-Email verifying tool
-AWS lamba for go
-CRM with golang fiber
-HRMS with golang fiber
